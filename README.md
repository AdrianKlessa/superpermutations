### Superpermutations

This repository contains various scripts related to looking for the shortest superpermutations, aka the *Haruhi problem*

The `superpermutations for n4.ipynb` file contains a proof-of-concept of using the Proximal Policy Optimization RL algorithm to find the shortest superpermutation on an alphabet with 4 symbols.

### Tools used:

* Gymnasium API was used to create a reinforcement learning environment compatible with other libraries
* Stable Baselines3 was used to train RL agents on the aforementioned environment
